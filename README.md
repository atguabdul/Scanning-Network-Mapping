# Scanning-Network-Mapping

Scanning and network mapping are essential parts of cybersecurity, helping identify active hosts, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities in a network.

📌 What is Information Gathering?
Information Gathering is the process of collecting data about a target system, network or organization. It is the first step in ethical hacking penetration testing and cybersecurity assessments, helping attackers and defenders understand potential vulnerabilities and is divided into Passive and Active methods:

🟢 Passive Information Gathering
Passive information gathering involves collecting data without directly interacting with the target system.

● Domain & IP Analysis

  - Social Media
  
  - Search Engines
  
● DNS Recon

  - Google Dorks
  
Google advanced search operators for finding exposed files and sensitive data.

🔴 Active Information Gathering
Active information gathering requires direct interaction with the target system, often triggering logs and alerts.

● Scanning

   - Network Mapping/Host Discovery
   
   - Port Scanning
   
● Enumeration

   - Service & OS Fingerprinting




# 🛠 Tools for Scanning & Mapping
Here are some popular tools used in scanning and network mapping:

● Nmap – Port scanning and host discovery

● Masscan – Ultra-fast port scanning

● Wireshark – Network traffic analysis

● Shodan – Internet-connected device search

● FOCA – Metadata analysis
